== Description ==

In January, 2022 a German court ruled that a website owner should pay a â‚¬ 100,- fine, because embedded Google Fonts were used, essentially transferring the user's personal data (IP address) without the user's prior consent.

This ruling doesn\'t go for just Google Fonts; loading any file from a server *outside* the European Union is in breach of GDPR.

GDPRess eliminates embedded resources (scripts (JS) and stylesheets (CSS)), downloads them and automatically rewrites the URLs in your site's frontend.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/gdpr-press` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
3. Use the Settings -> Optimize Google Fonts screen to configure the plugin

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I remove/preload stylesheets and/or scripts with this plugin? =

No, because there are other plugins (like Asset Cleanup or Autoptimize) that are already excellent at that.

= GDPRess downloaded a stylesheet/script, but I'm still seeing requests to font files loaded by the stylesheet? =

GDPRess parses the stylesheet for defined src urls. But if it somehow missed it, I'd love to hear about that, because that might be a bug. Please head over to the support forum and submit a ticket, and include the full URL to the external stylesheet.
